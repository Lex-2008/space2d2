Easy mode: you can fly through stars, planets, and cross your own path.

Hard mode: nothing like this.

In both Easy and Hard modes, game is saved locally in your browser, and travelling between stars is instant.

In Real mode, however, travelling between stars takes 10 hours of real time,
and your game progress is saved on the server (you need to login / register on the server for that).
